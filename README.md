## Description

This was our first group project as part of the Adelaide University Coding Bootcamp, undertaken at the end of the foundation modules in section 1.
The project gave us the opportunity to practice collaboration and utilise Git branches, pull requests, code reviews and merging.
We created our own user story, wireframe and user flow diagram.
We utilised HTML, Materialize CSS, JavaScript, and APIs from YouTube and The Dog API.

## Psuedo code requirements

* Must use at least two server-side APIs
* Must use a CSS framework other than Bootstrap
* Must be interactive (i.e: accept and respond to user input)
* Use at least one new third-party API
* Must have a polished UI
* Must meet good quality coding standards
* Does not use alerts, confirms or prompts (look into modals)
* Must be deployed to GitHub Pages

## User Story

```
As a dog lover:
    I want to determine the perfect breed of dog for me
    So that I can find my new best friend!

```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
Given a form with selections,

When I select a particular breed of dog,
Then I am presented with the following information regarding that breed:
What it is bred for;
The breed group it is from;
Height(cm);
Life Span;
Temperament;
Weight(kg);

When I select a particular breed of dog,
Then I am presented with a selection of videos from YouTube featuring that breed.

```

## Mock-Up

The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:
